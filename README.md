![Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300.png?text=Smart+Home+Control+App)

A beautifully designed Flutter-based mobile application for managing your smart home devices with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Control devices, manage rooms, and automate routines seamlessly from a single dashboard.

## Features

### 1. Dashboard (Home Screen)
The heart of the app, providing an at-a-glance overview of your smart home:
- **Favorites**: Pin your most-used devices (e.g., lights, thermostat) to the top for quick access.
- **Status Overview**: Instantly view critical statuses like `Front Door: Locked`, `Temperature: 22°C`, or `3 Lights On` without tapping.
- **Scene Shortcuts**: One-tap buttons to trigger routines like "I'm Home," "Good Night," or "Movie Time" for effortless control.

### 2. Automation / Routines
Make your home smarter with simple yet powerful automation:
- **"If This, Then That" (IFTTT) Logic**: Create routines using a trigger-and-action format.
  - *Trigger (If)*: "When the Front Door unlocks..."
  - *Condition (And if)*: "...and it's after sunset..."
  - *Action (Then)*: "...turn on the Hallway Lights."
- **Flexible Triggers**: Design automations based on device status, time of day, location (geofencing), or sensor data.

### 3. Rooms / Groups
Organize your devices by rooms for intuitive navigation:
- **Room-based Navigation**: Swipe between or select rooms to view and control devices.
- **Room-level Control**: Turn off all devices in a room with a single "Turn Off All" button.
